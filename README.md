This application uses the Vaadin web gui framework (https://vaadin.com/home).

How to install the eclipse plugin is described here https://vaadin.com/eclipse

The update site is http://vaadin.com/eclipse

Vaadin works with all appservers. This application has been built using the apache runtime version 8 (apache-tomcat-8.0.9)

The project is dynamic web project . To launch run as "Run on server". 

The  home page for this project is http://localhost:8080/WA/

Vaadin is super clever . You dont need a web.xml file. The latest version uses annotations.

Time does not permit file consistency  checks. I have assumed the file formats are good and also that the id is the first field and the decision field the last.

The eclipse version used in this app was 

Version: Luna Service Release 1 (4.4.1)
Build id: 20140925-1800
